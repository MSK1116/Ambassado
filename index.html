            <h4>Who we are?</h4>
            <p class="p-1">With the motive of bringing positive changes in the today's society, high-school friends camp
                up with the
                idea of
                establishing an non-profit organization in the valley. To lighten up the idea they, in co-ordination
                with eachother,
                gave the name to the organization “Everest TechSo Network”, which was indeed a good name which can
                reflect their moto.
                The moto of their organization was to serve the society via technology.

                This organization is non other than the organization that you are witnessing now. We are here to impact
                the society as
                an protagonist. To extend our effort in the technological field sothat we can invest the result into the
                welfare of the
                society. In this world of technology we are heading to uplift the society along with gaining the new
                experiences,fun and
                knowledge. It is being govern by technology enthusiasts and looking forward to recruit some more
                societyphile and
                technology enthusiasts in the coming future.
